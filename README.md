# Using CodePipeline to move a CloudFormation template on GitHub to S3 Bucket.
This Project was practice using a AWS CloudFormation to automate a static website on AWS S3 through AWS CodePipeline. Every part of this project was example code.
#
**Steps**
1. Create a Repository on GitHub and add a simple CloudFormation template to create a s3 Bucket.
2. Create a service role for CodePipeline using Iam. (Customize an ec2 roleâ€™s trust entity to fit for CodePipeline)
3. Create a service role for CodeFormation, add the s3 full access policy.
4. Create a Pipeline in CodePipeline.
5. Add the CodePipeline service role and add Github as the source provider (Add the repository with the cloudformation template in it.
6. Add CloudFormation as the deployment provider and create a stack. For the Artifact name use the Source Artifact and for the file name use the file name of the template saved on GitHub.
7. Create the CodePipeline, it will take a few seconds for it to be deployed.
8. Test the pipeline by making changes to the CloudFormation template code on the GitHub repository.
